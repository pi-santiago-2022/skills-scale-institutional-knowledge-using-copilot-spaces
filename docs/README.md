# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme follows customer-first, iterative delivery, and clear ownership principles for project management. Key phases include Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Roles and artifacts are defined in individual documents. Communication cadence and escalation paths ensure visibility and risk management.

Our approach emphasizes:
- **Customer-First Focus**: All decisions prioritize customer value and outcomes
- **Iterative Delivery**: Regular incremental releases and feedback cycles
- **Clear Ownership**: Well-defined roles and accountability at each phase
- **Visibility & Risk Management**: Proactive communication and escalation protocols
